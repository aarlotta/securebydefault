# 🔐 SecureByDefault

> **A curated collection of secure-by-default PowerShell scripts and tools.**  
> Built for professionals who care about clarity, reliability, and safe defaults.

---

## 🧭 Project Vision

**SecureByDefault** is an open-source initiative by [Anderson Arlotta](https://github.com/aarlotta) to publish minimal, high-quality PowerShell scripts that are:

- ✅ **Secure by default** — no dangerous defaults, no assumptions
- 🧼 **Clean and readable** — built for engineers, not obscured with wrappers
- 📦 **Fully functional** — production-ready as-is
- ⚙️ **Designed for extension** — easily fork, enhance, or layer onto CI/CD workflows

> This repo is a launchpad — not a locked box. Each script is designed to get you moving fast **without compromising security**.

## 📚 What's Inside

This repo includes foundational tools like:

- `Initialize-SecureProject.ps1`  
  Bootstrap your next PowerShell module with Git integration, testing, and commit standards — **all idempotent and remote-safe**.

- `ModuleScaffold.ps1` *(coming soon)*  
  Auto-create standard PowerShell module structure with internal/private folder separation and optional docs/test scaffolding.

- `SelfTestHarness.ps1` *(coming soon)*  
  A reusable testing harness for validating secure startup or environment readiness.

> All scripts follow a uniform design standard: **minimal, secure, well-documented.**

---

## 🧱 Why Minimal?

Simplicity isn’t a limitation — it’s an advantage.

- You know exactly what the script does.
- You can safely build on top of it.
- It’s ready for review, audit, or integration.

No bloat. No black-box behavior. Just clean PowerShell that works.
